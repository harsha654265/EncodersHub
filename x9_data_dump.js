Eeswar (Prabhas) is a motherless child and brat living in Dhoolpet, a slum area in Old City. Eeswar's father (Siva Krishna) manufactures Gudumba (arrack) with the help of neighborhood people. Eeswar falls in love at first sight when he sees a college going beauty Indu (Sridevi). In the meantime, Eeswar's father marries Sujatha (Revathi), who has been waiting for him for the past 20 years so that she can be a good mother to Eeswar. Eeswar hates his stepmother thinking that his father married her to enjoy worldly pleasures. Meanwhile, Indu's father turns out to be a local MLA (Ashok Kumar) who hates poor. The local MLA sends goons to finish him off Eeswar. What follows next forms the second half of the film.",
