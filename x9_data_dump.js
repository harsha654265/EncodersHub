    "description": "Munna (Prabhas) is a college student aiming to eliminate mafia don Kakha (Prakash Raj), who controls the city. Munna seeks personal vengeance against Kakha, his estranged father, responsible for his mother's death and his sister's murder. An honest politician, Srinivasa Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao), is killed while exposing Kakha. Munna's classmate Nidhi (Ileana D'Cruz) falls in love with him. A rival don, Aatma (Rahul Dev), tries to recruit Munna, but he refuses. A mind game ensues as Munna challenges Kakha, with Kakha's second wife and children joining Munna after betrayals and the death of his best friend reveal Aatma's allegiance to Kakha.",
